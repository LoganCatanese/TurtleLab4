#ITCS-1140 Final Project
###The main goal of this project was to work with a group of individuals to create a program and have both logic and design

I was the team lead for this project and I came up with the idea of using Matplotlib to graph user input, I was able to direct everyone into using Python, Pip, and installing the Matplotlib dependencies

#Libraries we used for the project
##Matplotlib (https://matplotlib.org/stable/)
Installing Matplotlib to your environment
>Pip install Matplotlib

#Numpy (https://numpy.org/)
Installing Numpy to your environment
>Pip install Numpy

#Compiling the code
>Python ./Main.py will run the code, you will need to input values for the graphs to display

I based this project off of the requirements given by the professor, he asked that we used a nested loop, logic in the program, at least 3 functions, an input statement, and output to the turtle screen (we used Matplotlib not Turtle). We got extra points for using Github for documentation. We used arrays to graph the values that the user inputs to the console. I was the one who wrote the functions and the others in the group wrote some of the code that was inside of the functions.

#Who did what in the program
I was the one who wrote all of the functions to ouput the graphs, Nathan Tucker used the two lists and arrays, Matthew designed the list to be no longer than 4, and Christopher was the one who designed the nested loop
